# 0x00. Hello, World

## Overview

This project introduces the C programming language, covering the basics of writing, compiling, and
running C programs. The primary focus is on understanding the GCC compiler, the structure of
a C program, primitive data types, and basic input and output operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of a C program.
- Comprehend the compilation process and learn how to use the GCC compiler.
- Write simple C programs that print text to the console.
- Use basic functions like `printf`.

## Projects

**0-preprocessor**: A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

**1-compiler**: A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

**2-assembler**: A script that generates the assembly code of a C file.

**3-name**: A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

**4-puts.c**: A C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using `puts()`.

**5-printf.c**: A C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using `printf()`.

**6-size.c**: A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

**100-intel**: A script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file.

**101-quote.c**: A C program that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, to standard error.
