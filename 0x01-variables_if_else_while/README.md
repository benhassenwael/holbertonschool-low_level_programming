# 0x01. Variables, If Else, While

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding variables, data types, conditional statements, and loops in C. It lays the foundation for
writing more complex programs by introducing control structures.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use variables and data types.
- Implement conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- Use loops (`while`, `for`, `do...while`).
- Learn logical and relational operators.

## Projects

**0-positive_or_negative.c** - A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive or negative.

**1-last_digit.c** - A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

**2-print_alphabet.c** - A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**3-print_alphabets.c** - A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

**4-print_alphabet.c** - A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e`.

**5-print_numbers.c** - A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`.

**6-print_numberz.c** - A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` using `putchar`.

**7-print_tebahpla.c** - A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

**8-print_base16.c** - A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

**9-print_comb.c** - A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

**10-print_comb2.c** - A C program that prints the numbers from `00` to `99`.

### Advanced Tasks

**100-print_comb3.c** - This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by `,` followed by a space, in ascending order.

**101-print_comb4.c** - This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by `,` followed by a space, in ascending order.

**102-print_comb5.c** - This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a space, in ascending order.
